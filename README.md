# Identification of Enhancer-Silencer Jungles in the Human Genome
Probabilistic analysis of datasets containing genomic information to surmise interactivity between genomic elements. While the code shown here is all in Python, R was used to display data and surmise some parameters of the data using simple statistics. This project took place between June 2014 and May 2015, and was conducted under the supervision of Dr. Ivan Ovcharenko and Dr. Shan Li at the National Center for Biotechnology Information.
